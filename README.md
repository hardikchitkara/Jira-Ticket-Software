# Jira-Ticket-Sofetware
# It is a software where we can generate tickets to make things noted down on a place.
# I have used local storage in the browser to set your generated tickets remember by the brower for future purpose.
# I have implemented features like delete using delete button, by making in on and clicking on ticket will delete the ticket from UI as well as the local storage.
# Implemented Add button to add tickets.
# Colours containers in toolbar will show tickets of a particular colour.
# To show all the tickets, i have implemented Heart Button on the toolbar which show all the current tickets made by the user.
# All the features are also implemented after reloading the browser i.e. after adding in local storage.
