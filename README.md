# Jira-Ticket-Software

It is a software where we can generate tickets to make things noted down on a place.

I have used local storage in the browser to set your generated tickets remember by the brower for future purpose.

I have implemented features like delete using delete button, by making in on and clicking on ticket will delete the ticket from UI as well as the local storage.

Implemented Add button to add tickets.

Colours containers in toolbar will show tickets of a particular colour.

To show all the tickets, i have implemented Heart Button on the toolbar which show all the current ticketsmade by the user.

All the features are also implemented after reloading the browser i.e. after adding in local storage.

Each Ticket has a usique id in-built which will differentiate between different tasks.

We can edit the each and every ticket for getting data change.

I have also implemented Lock Button. After making it on, it will lock each and every function of the application.

Here is the Glimplse of UI:
