# Jira-Ticket-Software

1) It is a software where we can generate tickets to make things noted down on a place.

2) Implemented local storage in the browser to set your generated tickets remember by the brower for future purpose.

3) Implemented features like delete using delete button, by making in on and clicking on ticket will delete the ticket from UI as well as the local storage.

4) Implemented Add button to add tickets, it will create a ticket both on UI and in browser's local storage after pressing Enter button.

5) Colours containers in toolbar will show tickets of a particular colour.

6) To show all the tickets, i have implemented Heart Button on the toolbar which show all the current tickets made by the user.

7) All the features will survive even after reloading the browser i.e. implemented using local storage in browser.

8) Each Ticket has a unique in-built id which will differentiate between different tasks of same category or same colour.

9) We can edit each and every ticket for getting data change.

10) Implemented Lock Button. After making it on, it will lock each and every function of the application.
